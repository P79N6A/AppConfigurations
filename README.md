# App Configurations
Because I have to switch between many devices (i.e. Linux, macOS, Windows, vps, NAS, etc.) and softwares (i.e. Safari, Chrome, etc.), sometimes the software need to be reconfigured as I reinstall or switch the system.

## SafariStylish
Stylish CSS file for Safari on Mac OS, Mainly used for adblock.

Some adblock extensions, i.e Adblock/ABP/ublock/etc. for Safari on MacOS can not customize rules. 
Stylish can be used for this purpose through css file.
